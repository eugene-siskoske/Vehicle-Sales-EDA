# Vehicle-Sales-EDA
Analysis of used vehicle sales in the US market.

Please view the Jupypter Notebook file for the full analysis of the data.

This is a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) of about 500,000 transactions in the US used vehicle market. Each step of the process is commented in the notebook but I will also elaborate here.

I first looked at a few basic summary statistics of the data, then dealt with the NA/NULL values. Then I went through and removed the outlier values that were most likely placeholder values in my estimation. 

Next I went through and analyzed more of the data based on some columns I calculated, including a categorical variable for warranties, as well as analyzing various aspects of the vehicle prices based on different factors. There are also plenty of tables and graphs built within the notebook using Pandas and Numpy.
